# Scientific Calculator

Scientific Calculator is a Java application that provides advanced mathematical calculations and functions. The calculator features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
- Logarithmic functions (log, ln).
- Exponentiation (^).
- Modulo operator (%).
- Parentheses for grouping expressions.
- Support for decimal numbers.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Scientific Calculator, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above

### Running the Application

  Clone the repository or download the source code files.
## Usage
1. The calculator window will open, displaying a text field and a grid of buttons.

2. Enter an expression in the text field using the provided buttons and operators.

3. Click the "=" button or press Enter to evaluate the expression.

4. The result will be displayed in the text field. If the expression is invalid, an "Error" message will be shown.

5. To clear the text field, click the "C" button.

6. To delete the last character, click the "\u2190" button or use the backspace key.

## Supported Operators and Functions
The Scientific Calculator supports the following operators and functions:

- Basic Arithmetic Operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (/), Modulo (%)
- Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan
- Logarithmic Functions: log, ln
- Exponentiation: ^
- Parentheses: ( )
- Decimal Numbers: 0-9 and .

## Examples
- Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
- Subtraction: 7 - 2 = 5
- Multiplication: 4 x 6 = 24
- Division: 9 / 3 = 3
- Modulo: 10 % 3 = 1
- Trigonometric Functions: sin(30) = 0.5, cos(45) = 0.707, tan(60) = 1.732
- Logarithmic Functions: log(100) = 2, ln(2.718) = 1
- Exponentiation: 2^3 = 8
- Parentheses: (2 + 3) x 4 = 20
